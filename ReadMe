To Run Project:

- create env (retail_venv)
- This project does not rely on dbâ€™s or models, so no need to make db or make migrations
- $ pip install -r requirements.txt
- $ python manage.py runserver

To make Noun Api Work:
- You need to generate an api key and secret api key from thenounproject.com
- Create a .env file at the project folder level and create two separate variables:
    api_key = "api key string"
    secret_key = "secrete key string"
In the views file the .env should get loaded from load_dotenv and parsed out by our os.envrion[variable]
